# relg-gen
Angular-based generator for fictional religions.

Pretty simple. This version is all frontend, using simple arrays and factories to demonstrate how factories
can tie into controllers. Next version will probably shift much of this into redis, firebase, etc, and 
possibly abstracting things out further, just to demonstrate how directives could help with that.

Other than that, there's probably no real-world application for this, other than as a randomized generator,
but tackling the logic was a lot of fun on a rainy day.
